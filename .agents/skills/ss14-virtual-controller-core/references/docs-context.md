# Docs Context (VirtualController Core)

## The role of documentation

1. Use Docs for terminology, intent and diagnostics.
2. Always check the behavior of the system using the current code.
3. If there is a conflict between docs vs code, choose code.

## Relevant pages

This catalog owns the shared doc pages for the physics pipeline and prediction/networking.

1. `robust-toolbox/transform/physics.md` — date `2023-09-21` `[unverified]`.
Purpose: general picture of the physics pipeline and the place of VirtualControllers.
Trust limitation: the page is out of date, there is a TODO, use only as a high-level intent.

2. `ss14-by-example/prediction-guide.md` — date `2026-02-04` `[unverified]`.
Purpose: practice prediction, replay/re-sim and guard patterns.
Reliance limitation: guidance on methodology, but always check specific examples against current systems.

3. `ss14-by-example/basic-networking-and-you.md` — date `2024-05-31` `[unverified]`.
Purpose: `Dirty`/network fields/ComponentState for shared predict scripts.
Trust constraint: Useful as a basic network model, but not a replacement for reading runtime code.

## Practice using docs

1. First, find the latest implementation in the code (verify freshness by `git blame` of the anchor line and the fork's last upstream sync point).
2. Then check the docs for terminology and explanations.
3. If the docs are being pushed into a legacy approach, record this in `rejected-snippets.md`.
